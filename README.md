# Vital-signs-simulator
Simulation of a wearable device collecting vital signs information over a period of time and analysis.

Parameters are set for ‘normal’ and ‘abnormal’ ranges of the signs.

Functions are created to identify abnormal values for pulse rate, create histograms of the pulse rate and a calculation of the computational cost. 

A health analyser function is created which provides a query mechanism to search for a particular sign value. 

Finally all phases of the work are benchmarked to test the scalability of the algorithms on increasing  record collection volumes. 

The report/technical annex created as part of the work is included in the repository.
